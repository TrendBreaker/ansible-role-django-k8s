Changes
-------

v0.0.8 on Sep 21, 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Suport redirect from www.domain.com to domain.com or vice versa.


v0.0.7 on Jul 28, 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Support environment-specific Amazon S3 bucket creation (#27)


v0.0.6 on Jul 2, 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Allow full customization of the arguments to the celery command. (#17, #23)
* Enable ``collectstatic`` command to run during deploy (#24)


v0.0.5 on Jun 16, 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add ``fsGroup`` to the beat service which allows that service to access the data
  volume, if it is not running as root.

v0.0.4 on Jun 15, 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Wait until Job-created migration pod returns ``Completed`` status before continuing
  deploy
* Set celery-beat ImagePullPolicy to match user-configured setting

v0.0.3 on Apr 28, 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* If ``k8s_rollout_after_deploy`` is ``true``, use rollout to ensure that pods are restarted
  when we deploy. This ensures that even if our image tag is unchanged (like if
  we're using a branch name), we'll still pull the latest image with that tag and
  be running it when the deploy completes.

v0.0.2 on Apr 15, 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Made some changes to simplify setting up a deploy account so this can be run from
  continuous integration.

  *If updating from v0.0.1*:

  * ``k8s_auth_host`` is now a required variable - see the README.rst.
  * After setting that, please run first locally with kubectl set up
    to access the cluster, and follow any instructions that are output.


v0.0.1 on Mar 26, 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Initial release
